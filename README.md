# Protocol Interface - The Deed Protocol UI Kit

This repository contains the **Frontend UI Kit** for The Deed Protocol. It serves as an open design system and a forkable white-label UI solution, featuring prebuilt components, fully designed pages, and an extensive style guide. This UI kit is designed to help developers and designers rapidly build consistent, accessible, and visually appealing frontend applications that interact seamlessly with the protocol.

## Overview

The Protocol Interface provides a comprehensive, ready-to-use design system that empowers teams to create high-quality user interfaces for decentralized real estate applications. Whether you’re building a custom solution or adapting a white-label design, this UI kit offers the building blocks needed to accelerate development while ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices in UI/UX design.

## Key Components

### 1. Component Library

The heart of the UI kit is its extensive library of reusable components. These components are designed to be flexible, accessible, and easy to integrate into any frontend project. Some key components include:

- **Buttons, Forms, and Inputs:** Standard UI elements with customizable themes and behaviors.
- **Navigation & Menus:** Responsive navigation components that support both desktop and mobile experiences.
- **Cards & Lists:** Layout components for displaying property data, NFT details, or transaction histories.
- **Modals & Notifications:** Interactive components for alerts, confirmations, and user feedback.

### 2. Prebuilt Pages

The UI kit includes a set of prebuilt pages that demonstrate common application flows and use cases. These pages serve as templates that can be easily customized or extended. Examples include:

- **Dashboard:** An overview of property assets, transactions, and notifications.
- **Property Details:** Detailed views for individual real estate assets, including metadata and validation status.
- **User Profile:** Pages for managing user information, wallet connections, and transaction history.
- **Transaction Flow:** Step-by-step interfaces for minting deeds, validating properties, and managing funds.

### 3. Style Guide

A robust style guide is provided to ensure visual consistency across your application. The style guide includes:

- **Typography:** Guidelines for font families, sizes, and weights.
- **Color Palette:** A defined set of colors used throughout the UI, supporting both light and dark themes.
- **Spacing & Layout:** Recommendations for margins, padding, and grid systems.
- **Design Tokens:** Variables for colors, fonts, and dimensions that can be easily adjusted to customize the overall look and feel.

## Features

- **Open Design System:** Fully documented components and styles that adhere to modern design standards.
- **Forkable White-Label UI:** Easily customize the UI to match your brand’s identity or project requirements.
- **Prebuilt Components & Pages:** Accelerate development with ready-to-use components and page templates.
- **Responsive & Accessible:** Designed to work seamlessly on various devices and adhere to accessibility best practices.
- **Themed Customization:** Easily modify design tokens and styles to create unique user experiences without sacrificing consistency.

## Usage

### Customizing the UI Kit

The UI kit is built to be easily customizable. You can fork the repository and modify the prebuilt components, pages, and style definitions to match your project’s branding. For example:

- **Updating Colors & Fonts:**  
  Modify the design tokens located in the theme or style configuration files.
  
- **Extending Components:**  
  Create new components or extend existing ones by following the established design patterns and documentation within the repository.

### Integrating with The Deed Protocol

While the UI kit focuses on the frontend design, it is designed to work seamlessly with the underlying Protocol Smart Contracts and the SDK. Use the prebuilt components and layouts to create interfaces that can:

- **Display Real-Time Data:**  
  Show live updates from blockchain events and transactions.
  
- **Facilitate Transactions:**  
  Integrate with wallet providers and the Protocol SDK to enable property minting, validation, and fund management.

For more details on integrating with the smart contracts and SDK, please refer to the [Protocol Smart Contracts](https://github.com/Deed3Labs/Protocol-Contracts/tree/contract-changes) and [Protocol SDK](https://github.com/Deed3Labs/ProtocolSDK/tree/contract-changes) repositories.

## Testing

To ensure that the UI kit components and pages function as expected, run the provided test suite:

```bash
npm run test
# or if using Yarn:
yarn test
```

Tests cover component rendering, interaction behaviors, and responsive design aspects.
